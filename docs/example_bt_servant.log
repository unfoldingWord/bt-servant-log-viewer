In translating John 4:1-2, several key translation challenges and considerations arise based on the original text and the nature of the language.

In John 4:1, the verse provides background information leading up to Jesus‚Äô conversation with the Samaritan woman. This narrative setup requires careful consideration of how your target language naturally conveys background before a dialogue. Keep in mind that the original Greek sentence spans John 4:1‚Äì3, forming a long, complex sentence that might need to be broken into several shorter sentences, depending on the natural sentence structure of your language. 

Another point to consider is the phrase order. In Greek, "Now Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John. When he knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was doing this" suggests flexibility. You have the option to reorder these clauses if it flows better in your language.

The term "Then" at the beginning of the verse introduces a new event occurring sometime after the previous events without specifying the exact lapse of time. This should be translated into a natural expression in your language for introducing new events, such as "Some time later, when Jesus knew."

In John 4:2, the emphasis is on the fact that "Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were." In languages that use specific mechanisms to denote emphasis, be sure to adequately stress that Jesus was not the one performing the baptisms; instead, his disciples were. 

The phrase in Greek omits some words that might be necessary for clarity in other languages. You could consider adding words from the previous clause for completeness and clarity, such as "but his disciples were baptizing people."

With these guidelines, ensure that you adapt the translation to best fit the narrative flow and grammatical structure of your target language, preserving the intended meaning and emphasis.

What specific aspects of the next passage or translation challenge would you like help with?

Would you like me to tell you about Isaiah in the Bible?

(Matthew 28:19b ULT)'\\n\\nThe intimate, loving relationship between the Father and the Son is eternal, just as they are eternal. The Father loves the Son.

But this does not mean that the translator should avoid the concepts of father and son. The Scriptures use these terms to refer to God, the perfect Father and Son, as well as to sinful human fathers and sons. In referring to God as Father and Son, choose words in your language that are widely used to refer to a human \\u201cfather\\u201d and \\u201cson.\\u201d In this way you will communicate that God the Father and God the Son are of the same divine essence (they are both God), just as a human father and son are of the same human essence (they are both human and share the same human characteristics).\\n\\nTranslation Strategies\\n\\n(1) Think through all the possibilities within your language to translate the words \\u201cson\\u201d and \\u201cfather.\\u201d Determine which words in your language best represent the divine \\u201cSon\\u201d and \\u201cFather.\\u201d (2) If your language has more than one word for \\u201cson,\\u201d use the word that has the closest meaning to \\u201conly son\\u201d (or \\u201cfirst son\\u201d if necessary).

What are some suggestions for how I might translate Bible verses stating that Jesus is the Son of God in ways that are faithful, but also without being culturally offensive?\"], \"article_body\": \"Create Faithful Translations\\n\\nFaithful Translations\\n\\nTo make a translation that is faithful to the Bible, you must avoid any political, denominational, ideological, social, cultural, or theological bias in your translation. Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Use equivalent common language terms for the biblical words that describe the relationship between God the Father and God the Son. These may be clarified, as needed, in footnotes or other supplemental resources.\\n\\nYour goal as a Bible translator is to communicate the same message that the original writer of the Bible intended to communicate. This means that you should not try to communicate your own message, or the message that you think the Bible should say, or that your church thinks the Bible should say. For any Bible passage, you must communicate what it says, all of what it says, and only what it says. You must resist the temptation to put any of your own interpretations or messages into the Bible. Do not add any meaning to the message that is not already there in the Bible passage. (The message of a Bible passage includes the implied information.\\n\\nYou must also use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Read the definitions of the unfoldingWord\\u00ae Translation Words to make sure that you understand the meanings of these words. Translate so that these key terms have these same meanings, and do not translate them in different ways just to please your pastor, your village leaders, or yourself.\\n\\nAlways translating faithfully can be difficult for several reasons:\\n\\n1.) You might be used to the way that your church interprets some Bible passages, and you might not know that there are other interpretations. Example: When you are translating the word \\u201cbaptize,\\u201d you might want to translate it with a word that means \\u201csprinkle\\u201d because that is what your church does. But after reading unfoldingWord\\u00ae Translation Words, you learn that the word has a meaning in the range of \\u201cplunge,\\u201d \\u201cdip,\\u201d \\u201cwash,\\u201d or \\u201cpurify.\\u201d\\n\\n2.) You might want to translate a Bible passage in a way that accords with your culture rather than according with what it meant when it was written.  Example: It is common in North American culture for women to speak and preach in churches. A translator from that culture might be tempted to translate the words of 1 Corinthians 14:34a in a way that is not as strict as the Apostle Paul wrote them: \\u201cLet the women be silent in the churches.\\u201d But a faithful translator will translate the meaning of the Bible passage just the way it is.\\n\\n3.) You might not like something that the Bible says, and you might be tempted to change it. Example: You might not like what Jesus says in John 6:53, \\u201cTruly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves.\\u201d This may seem disgusting to you, but you must translate it faithfully so that your people can read it and contemplate what Jesus meant by it.\\n\\n4.) You might be afraid of what others in your village will think or do if they read a faithful translation of what the Bible says. Example: You might be tempted to translate God\\u2019s words in Matthew 3:17, \\u201cThis is my beloved Son. I am very pleased with him,\\u201d with a word that does not mean \\u201cson.\\u201d But you must remember that you do not have the right to change the meaning of what the Bible says.\\n\\n5.) You might know something extra about the Bible passage that you are translating, and you might want to add that to your translation. Example: When you are translating Mark 10:11, \\u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her,\\u201d you might know that in Matthew 19:9 there is also the phrase, \\u201c\\u2026 except for sexual immorality \\u2026.\\u201d Even so, do not add this phrase into Mark 10:11 because that would not be translating faithfully. Also, do not add any of your own ideas or any teachings from your church. Only translate the meaning that is there in the Bible passage.\"}",

    "document_text": "\n# The 6 FIA steps of drafting\n\n## INTRODUCTION\nCreating a translation draft is like making good food (like a cake). To make a good meal, you need to have certain ingredients (to make a cake, you just need flour, eggs, and sugar). In the same way, we need some basic ingredients to make a good translation draft. We call these ingredients  familiarization,  internalization, and articulation,  or  \"FIA.\"\n- Familiarization  helps a translation team know everything  in a passage very well (if appropriate, touch your head here).\n- Internalization  helps the team move that knowledge  to their heart so they understand the passage deeply (if appropriate, touch your heart here).\n- Articulation  helps the translation team begin to decide  how to translate a passage and practice expressing the passage in their own language (if appropriate, spread out your hands here).\n\nMaking good food also requires you to do certain things and follow a certain process. In the same way, the FIA steps have teams do specific activities and follow a specific process to create a translation draft. The activities and steps in the FIA process help make sure that the translation team:\n- Has all the information they need to know in order to translate that passage of scripture.\n- Deeply understands a passage of scripture so they can translate it well.\n- Has lots of practice in expressing the passage in their language\n\t\n\t\n## FIA Step #1:  Head and Heart\nIn this step, the idea is to hear the pass and put the passage in one's heart. Translators will watch or list the passage in a language of wider communication and in as many translations as they can. Then they will discuss the passage.\n\nFirst, listen to an audio version of the passage three times, in three different translations, if possible. Then, as a group, discuss the following questions. \n1. What do you like in this passage?\n2. What do you not like or not understand in this passage?\n3. What does this passage tell us about Jesus?\n4. What does this passage tell us about people?\n5. How does this passage affect our daily lives?\n6. Whho do you know who needs to hear this passage?\n\n## FIA Step #2:  Setting the Stage\nIn this step, translators will listen or watch the whole context of a passage. This context might be historical, cultural, linguistic, or geographical. Here, the translation team might look at pictures and maps to help them understand the context of the passage. The team will discuss some of that context as a group and talk about how that context relates to their own culture.\n\n## FIA Step #3:  Defining the Scenes\nIn this step the translators will hear about the different scenes and characters in a passage. They will visualize the scenes by drawing, storyboarding, or using random objects to show the different scenes and action in the passage.\n\n## FIA Step #4:  Embodying the Text\nIn this step, the translators act out the story two times. The first time, they act out the story without stopping. The second time, they stop at different points in the story and discuss what different characters might be feeling or thinking in the story.\n\n## FIA Step #5:  Filling the Gaps\nIn this step the translators focus on the specific words and key terms in the story. They discuss how they say things in their language, and begin to choose how they translate certain words and phrases.\n\n## FIA Step #6:  Signing or Speaking the Word\nIn this step the translation team will practice signing or speaking the passage. As a group, they will talk about the different words and phrases they will use  when they create a draft of the passage. \n",

    "document_text": "# SALVATION\r\n\r\nGod\u2019s way of providing people deliverance from sin and death. Scripture reveals God but it also reveals his plan to save the human race. In that sense, salvation is a major theme in both the OT and NT.\r\n\r\n## In the Old Testament\r\n\r\nThe concept of salvation is represented by various terms and situations in both Testaments. Among several Hebrew words that mean \u201cdeliver\u201d or \u201csave,\u201d the Hebrew verb yasha\u2018 and derivatives are most frequently translated by English versions as \u201csave\u201d or \u201csalvation.\u201d Frequency in the English Bible depends upon the version considered. For example, in the OT \u201csalvation\u201d is found 74 times in the nlt, 80 times in the niv, 90 times in the rsv, 111 times in the nasb, and 119 times in the kjv. Salvation is not used as a technical term in the OT and is ascribed to both individuals and God. Leaders like Samson (Jgs 13:5) or David (2\u00a0Sm 8:6) are used of the Lord to bring deliverance to God\u2019s people.\r\n\r\nIsrael\u2019s concept of salvation was rooted in the historical experience of the exodus. This momentous occasion was an opportunity to witness the salvation of the Lord (Ex 14:13) firsthand. Poets (Ps 106:8) and prophets (Is 43:3; Hos 13:4) later reiterated God\u2019s salvation when recalling the exodus experience. Israel\u2019s understanding of salvation was worked out in historical instances like Sennacherib\u2019s attack on Jerusalem in 701 BC, when the Lord declared that he would save the city for his name\u2019s sake (2\u00a0Kgs 19:34; cf. 18:30, 35). Israel\u2019s opportunity to see God\u2019s salvation through various leaders and situations corroborated this understanding of God as the God of salvation.\r\n\r\nIsrael\u2019s response to God\u2019s deliverance was primarily praise, as evidenced so often in the psalms (Pss 3:8; 9:14; 21:1) and earlier poetic passages (Ex 15:2; 1\u00a0Sm 2:1). In addition, they directed petitions and pleas for help to the Lord for his salvation\u2014whether from enemies (Pss 35:3; 38:22), sickness (69:29), or battle (140:7; 144:10-11)\u2014and in faith expected his deliverance (35:9; 65:5).\r\n\r\nThe prophets emphasized the eschatological (end-time) aspect of salvation. God\u2019s ability to save was revealed by his great works in the past, which thus promoted the anticipation of his work of deliverance in the future. This future hope was for the nation of Israel (Is 45:17) but anticipated universal deliverance (49:6). The prophets looked forward to deliverance and return from exile in Babylon (Is 49:25-26; Jer 46:27), yet they also spoke of an abiding future salvation (Is 45:17; 51:6-8). The messianic hope is indicated in passages that speak of an individual who will bring God\u2019s salvation. Isaiah speaks of the Servant who brings salvation to the ends of the earth (49:6), while Jeremiah writes of deliverance by God\u2019s righteous Branch (Jer 23:5-6). The mention of the king who brings salvation in Zechariah 9:9 reflects this messianic theme and is applied to Jesus Christ in Matthew 21:4-5.\r\n\r\n## In the New Testament\r\n\r\nIn classical Greek the verb sozo (\u201cto save\u201d) and noun soteria (\u201csalvation\u201d) are used for the concept of \u201crescue,\u201d \u201cdeliverance\u201d or \u201csalvation,\u201d and even \u201cwell-being\u201d or \u201chealth.\u201d The Septuagint most frequently uses sozo to render the Hebrew yasha\u2018 (\u201cto save\u201d), and the NT primarily employs sozo and its derivatives for the idea of salvation.\r\n\r\nThese Greek terms are generally used theologically in the NT, but examples of nontheological usage occur. In Acts 27, these words refer to the threat and deliverance of the soldiers, sailors, and prisoners from shipwreck (vv 20, 31), as well as their well-being (v 34).\r\n\r\nIn the Gospels \u201csalvation\u201d is clearly connected with the OT concept of salvation; it is applied to the coming of Christ in Zechariah\u2019s prophecy (Lk 1:69, 71; cf. Pss 106:10; 132:17) and in Simeon\u2019s hymn of praise (Lk 2:30). While soteria does not occur frequently in the Gospels, the concept of salvation is implied in Jesus\u2019 statement about entrance into the kingdom of God (Mt 19:24-26) and his miracles of healing (Lk 17:19; 18:42).\r\n\r\nThe NT teaches that salvation has its source in Jesus Christ (2\u00a0Tm 2:10; Heb 5:9), who is the \u201cauthor\u201d and mediator of salvation (Heb 2:10; 7:25). Salvation is God\u2019s work (1\u00a0Thes 5:9) and is offered by his grace (Eph 2:8-9). The message of salvation is contained in the Scriptures (2\u00a0Tm 3:15) and is carried by those who proclaim the word of truth (Eph 1:13). The appropriate response is repentance (2\u00a0Cor 7:10) and faith (2\u00a0Tm 3:15; 1\u00a0Pt 1:9). This was the preaching of the early church as it proclaimed the Savior Jesus (Acts 4:12; 13:23-26; 16:30-31). Paul especially proclaimed the universality of God\u2019s offer of salvation (Rom 1:16; Ti 2:11). His desire was for Jews to be saved (Rom 10:1), though he primarily preached the message of salvation to the Gentiles (11:11-13).\r\n\r\nWithin the Scriptures there are many other terms associated with the concept of salvation. The new birth speaks of being made alive in Christ (\u201cborn again,\u201d Jn 3:3). Justification envisions one\u2019s legal standing before God, while redemption speaks more of the means of salvation\u2014the payment of a price to bring one back to God. Reconciliation speaks of a change in relationship and propitiation, which evokes the OT sacrificial system and points to the turning away of God\u2019s wrath. These terms and others share some common ground with the biblical concept of salvation, but all point to the person and work of Jesus Christ the Savior.\r\n\r\n*See also* Justification, Justified; Reconciliation; Redeemer, Redemption; Savior.",

Similarly, older women are advised to be reverent, not slanderous or prone to excessive drinking, but rather to teach what is good (2:3). They should guide younger women to love their families, be self-controlled, pure, and effective managers of their households (2:4-5). Younger men are urged to exhibit self-control as well (2:6). Titus himself is to model good works, integrity, dignity, and sound speech to leave no room for criticism (2:7-8). Slaves are advised to submit to their masters respectfully and with integrity, reflecting God's teachings through their behavior (2:9-10).

The passage emphasizes the grace of God bringing salvation to all, instructing believers to renounce ungodliness and live virtuous lives while awaiting the return of Jesus Christ (2:11-13). Jesus sacrificed Himself to redeem and purify a people eager to do good (2:14). Titus is also directed to encourage and correct with authority, ensuring that he is respected (2:15).

In Titus 3, Paul urges believers to submit to rulers and authorities, be obedient, and ready for good works (3:1). They are to speak no evil, be peaceable, gentle, and considerate to everyone (3:2). Paul reminds them of their past foolishness and sinful behaviors, contrasting it with the transforming kindness and love of God (3:3-4). Salvation came not through righteous deeds but through God‚Äôs mercy, involving a renewal by the Holy Spirit (3:5). This Spirit was generously given through Jesus Christ, making believers heirs with the hope of eternal life (3:6-7). Paul emphasizes that believers should focus on good deeds, which are beneficial for all (3:8). He instructs them to avoid pointless controversies and to reject divisive individuals after warnings (3:9-11). Paul sends personal instructions about Artemas, Tychicus, Zenas, and Apollos, emphasizing the importance of supporting each other to meet needs effectively (3:12-14). Finally, he closes with greetings and a blessing of grace (3:15).

In John 4:2-5, it is clarified that Jesus himself did not baptize people; rather, his disciples carried out the baptisms. Jesus then left Judea to return to Galilee, and it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria during this journey. He arrived in a Samaritan town called Sychar, which was located near a plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.

Would you like a summary of the next section in John 4?

In John 4, Jesus learns the Pharisees are aware of His growing number of disciples and leaves Judea for Galilee (4:1-3). Passing through Samaria, He stops at a well in Sychar where He encounters a Samaritan woman (4:4-6). Jesus requests water from her, leading to a profound conversation. Despite cultural tensions, he offers her "living water" which symbolizes eternal life (4:7-14). Their dialogue reveals her past, prompting her recognition of Jesus as a prophet and a discussion on true worship (4:15-24). Jesus identifies Himself as the Messiah, deepening the woman‚Äôs faith, and she shares this revelation with her town (4:25-30).

Meanwhile, Jesus speaks with His disciples about spiritual sustenance and the urgency of spiritual harvest (4:31-38). Many Samaritans believe in Jesus due to the woman‚Äôs testimony and His teachings (4:39-42). After two days, Jesus returns to Galilee, where He is welcomed, particularly because of His previous miracles (4:43-45). In Cana, He heals a royal official‚Äôs son remotely by His word, leading to belief within the official‚Äôs household and marking His second recorded miracle in Galilee (4:46-54).

Would you like a summary of a different section from the book of John?

Genesis 1:1 reads, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." This verse presents several translation challenges that are important to address carefully.

Firstly, the phrase "In the beginning" is derived from the Hebrew word "◊ë÷º÷∞‚Å†◊®÷µ◊ê◊©◊Å÷¥÷ñ◊ô◊™". This can sometimes require a verb instead of a noun in certain languages, as abstract nouns might not translate well. Therefore, consider using "At the beginning of time" or a similar phrase if it suits the target language better.

The verb "created" comes from the Hebrew "◊ë÷º÷∏◊®÷∏÷£◊ê", which signifies an action that only God undertakes, typically implying creation ex nihilo, or making something out of nothing. It‚Äôs important to preserve the uniqueness of this divine action in translation. If necessary, you might use a more generic term like "made," but ensure it conveys the connotation of divine creation.

Regarding "the heavens," which translates from "◊ê÷µ÷•◊™ ◊î÷∑‚Å†◊©◊Å÷º÷∏◊û÷∑÷ñ◊ô÷¥◊ù," an alternative translation could be "the sky," depending on how the target language perceives the concept of the heavens. Make sure it fits both the physical and potentially spiritual dimensions that the term might imply.

Finally, "the earth" refers specifically to the planet, communicated by "◊ï÷∞‚Å†◊ê÷µ÷•◊™ ◊î÷∏‚Å†◊ê÷∏÷Ω◊®÷∂◊•" in Hebrew. Ensure your translation unmistakably refers to the physical earth and not just the ground or land, as those terms might be too limiting.

In Genesis 1:2, the description of the earth as "formless and empty" presents a key translation challenge. This phrase could imply either that the earth lacked its current shape and life or that it was entirely desolate. Retaining both terms separately in your translation respects the original Hebrew's nuance. The Hebrew phrase "◊ï÷∞◊î÷∏◊ê÷∏◊®÷∂◊•" could initially be introduced with "Now" to naturally bridge the narrative from verse 1, depending on your language's conventions.

The expression "darkness over the surface of the deep" suggests omnipresent deep water shrouded in darkness. Translators might render this as "it was completely dark, with deep water everywhere," capturing the pervasive nature of these elements.

The phrase "Spirit of God was hovering" offers varied interpretations, such as "God's Spirit was hovering" or "a wind from God was blowing." Decide which aligns best with the context and tradition of your translation.

Verse 3 features God‚Äôs command, ‚ÄúLet there be light.‚Äù In your translation, emphasize the authoritative command aspect without suggesting permission or suggestion. "Let light exist" is an option that aligns closely with the original intent.

In Genesis 1:4, translating "good" entails more than noting God‚Äôs satisfaction; it implies that what God created was complete, high quality, and untainted by sin. Preserve this deeper meaning in your translation. The separation of light and darkness implies a structured division of time, perhaps expressed as "He caused the light to have its own time and the darkness its own time," ensuring clarity regarding the passage of time.

Finally, Genesis 1:5 articulates the naming of Day and Night. Here, "Day" refers solely to the daylight hours, which should be clear in your translation. Consider the natural way your language expresses sequences with events happening in succession, maintaining proper order such as "Then evening came, and then morning came." The term "one day" might need adjustment to "first day" if ordinal numbers align better with your language's structure, though some languages may prefer maintaining cardinal numbering throughout.

In Galatians 1:4-5, several translation challenges arise, particularly due to idiomatic expressions and abstract concepts in the original language.

In 1:4, the phrase "the one having given himself for our sins so that he might deliver us from the present evil age" refers back to ‚Äúour Lord Jesus Christ‚Äù mentioned earlier. There is no distinction being made between ‚Äúthe one‚Äù and Jesus Christ, so if it's beneficial in your language, consider clarifying this context. An alternative translation could be "who is the one having given himself...".

The term "sins" is used figuratively, representing the punishment deserved for sin. You may choose to convey this meaning directly by translating to "to take the punishment for our sins" or "to take the punishment we deserve because of our sins".

The possessive "our" is inclusive, indicating both writer and readers. Ensure this inclusivity is clear in your translation.

The concept of "sins" may not naturally translate as an abstract noun in every language. If so, you might use an adjective like "sinful" or paraphrase in a way that feels natural.

The phrase "so that" introduces a purpose clause. Communicate this intent clearly using an equivalent construct, such as "in order that".

"Present evil age" indicates a period marked by sinfulness. Consider paraphrasing this if necessary, to emphasize the sinful characteristics of the time, such as "this present time that is dominated by sinfulness" or "the evil powers at work in the world today".

When mentioning "and Father," it‚Äôs crucial to clarify that "our God" and "Father" are not separate. An alternative is "of our God, who is our Father".

In 1:5, "to whom {be} the glory forever {and} ever" is an expression of praise. If "glory" translates awkwardly as an abstract noun, a verbal form like "praise" can be used.

Finally, the word "Amen" is transliterated in the text and can be adapted in your language while possibly clarifying it with "so be it" for comprehension.

Would you like guidance on translating the next segment of Galatians, specifically 1:6-9?

In Galatians 1:6-9, several translation challenges arise, primarily due to the nuanced expressions and theological concepts Paul uses.

In verse 1:6, Paul expresses amazement at how quickly the Galatians are turning away from the gospel. The Greek term "Œ∏Œ±œÖŒºŒ¨Œ∂œâ" can be translated as "amazed," "surprised," or "shocked," depending on the emphasis needed in your language. The phrase "turning away" implies a process of departure from faith, which must be conveyed as ongoing but incomplete. To capture the speed of their departure, "so quickly" might need explicit elaboration, like "so soon after accepting the true gospel."

The phrase "the one having called you" refers to God, highlighting the divine action in choosing the Galatians. Clarifying that God is the subject may require explicit mention. "Called" can similarly be translated as "chosen." Additionally, the word "in" (Greek "·ºêŒΩ") can have varied implications‚Äîmeans, sphere, or manner‚Äîeach offering different nuances for the "grace of Christ." Consider whether to translate "grace" in more concrete terms, like "kindness," if abstract nouns are less common in your language.

In verse 1:7, the expression "which is not another" can seem incomplete; adding words like "another gospel" might be necessary. The word "except" can complicate the sentence's logic, and you may need to restructure it to avoid confusion. The term "trouble" might be expressed through a verb if abstract nouns are less natural, e.g., "troubling you." "Pervert" might translate to "twist the truth of" or "change."

Verse 1:8 introduces a hypothetical scenario, which must be clearly presented. Use your language's natural form for hypothetical situations. The plural "we" refers exclusively to Paul and his fellow workers, distinct from the Galatians. Ensure this exclusivity is clear if your language requires it. When translating "let him be cursed," consider using a culturally appropriate way of invoking a curse, and remember that "him" is generic, including both genders.

In verse 1:9, Paul repeats his warning. Ensure consistency with previous translations of similar phrases in 1:8, particularly "other than the one" and "let him be cursed."

Would you like to receive guidance on translating the subsequent verses in Galatians?

I am very pleased with him.\\u201d (Matthew 3:16-17 ULT)'\\n\\nThe Bible shows that Jesus called God his Father: 'Jesus \\u2026 said, \\u201cI praise you Father, Lord of heaven and earth \\u2026 no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son.\\u201d (Matthew 11:25a, 27b ULT) (See also: John 6:26-57)'\\n\\nChristians have found that \\u201cFather\\u201d and \\u201cSon\\u201d are the ideas that most essentially describe the eternal relationship of the First and Second Persons of the Trinity to each other. The Bible indeed refers to them in various ways, but no other terms reflect the eternal love and intimacy between these Persons, nor the interdependent eternal relationship between them.\\n\\nJesus referred to God in the following terms: 'Baptize them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19b ULT)'\\n\\nThe intimate, loving relationship between the Father and the Son is eternal, just as they are eternal. The Father loves the Son. (See John 3:35-36; 5:19-20 ULT)\\n\\nI love the Father, and just as the Father commanded me, thus I do. (John 14:31 ULT)\\n\\nNo one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son. (Luke 10:22b ULT)\\n\\nThe terms \\u201cFather\\u201d and \\u201cSon\\u201d also communicate that the Father and the Son are of the same essence; they are both eternal God.\\n\\nJesus said, \\u201cFather, \\u2026 glorify your Son so that the Son will glorify you \\u2026 I glorified you on the earth \\u2026 Now Father, glorify me \\u2026 with the glory that I had with you before the world was made.\\u201d (John 17:1, 4a, 5 ULT)\\n\\nBut in these last days, {God the Father} has spoken to us through a Son, whom he appointed to be the heir of all things. Through him, he also made the universe. He is the brightness of God\\u2019s glory and the very exact representation of his being. He holds everything together by the word of his power. (Hebrews 1:2-3a ULT)\\n\\nJesus said to him, \\u201cI have been with you for so long and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, \\u2018Show us the Father\\u2019?\\u201d (John 14:9 ULT)\\n\\nHuman Relationships\\n\\nHuman fathers and sons are not perfect, but the Bible still uses those terms for the Father and Son, who are perfect.\\n\\nJust as today, human father-son relationships during Bible times were never as loving or perfect as the relationship between Jesus and his Father. But this does not mean that the translator should avoid the concepts of father and son. The Scriptures use these terms to refer to God, the perfect Father and Son, as well as to sinful human fathers and sons. In referring to God as Father and Son, choose words in your language that are widely used to refer to a human \\u201cfather\\u201d and \\u201cson.\\u201d In this way you will communicate that God the Father and God the Son are of the same divine essence (they are both God), just as a human father and son are of the same human essence (they are both human and share the same human characteristics).\\n\\nTranslation Strategies\\n\\n(1) Think through all the possibilities within your language to translate the words \\u201cson\\u201d and \\u201cfather.\\u201d Determine which words in your language best represent the divine \\u201cSon\\u201d and \\u201cFather.\\u201d (2) If your language has more than one word for \\u201cson,\\u201d use the word that has the closest meaning to \\u201conly son\\u201d (or \\u201cfirst son\\u201d if necessary). (3) If your language has more than one word for \\u201cfather,\\u201d use the word that has the closest meaning to \\u201cbirth father,\\u201d rather than \\u201cadoptive father.\\u201d\"}",

    "document_text": "{\"name\": \"Create Faithful Translations\", \"questions_answered_by_article\": [\"What are faithful translations?\", \"I am trying to translate the Bible into a language where almost everyone is a Muslim. What are some suggestions for how I might translate Bible verses stating that Jesus is the Son of God in ways that are faithful, but also without being culturally offensive?\"], \"article_body\": \"Create Faithful Translations\\n\\nFaithful Translations\\n\\nTo make a translation that is faithful to the Bible, you must avoid any political, denominational, ideological, social, cultural, or theological bias in your translation. Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Use equivalent common language terms for the biblical words that describe the relationship between God the Father and God the Son. These may be clarified, as needed, in footnotes or other supplemental resources.\\n\\nYour goal as a Bible translator is to communicate the same message that the original writer of the Bible intended to communicate. This means that you should not try to communicate your own message, or the message that you think the Bible should say, or that your church thinks the Bible should say. For any Bible passage, you must communicate what it says, all of what it says, and only what it says. You must resist the temptation to put any of your own interpretations or messages into the Bible. Do not add any meaning to the message that is not already there in the Bible passage. (The message of a Bible passage includes the implied information.\\n\\nYou must also use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Read the definitions of the unfoldingWord\\u00ae Translation Words to make sure that you understand the meanings of these words. Translate so that these key terms have these same meanings, and do not translate them in different ways just to please your pastor, your village leaders, or yourself.\\n\\nAlways translating faithfully can be difficult for several reasons:\\n\\n1.) You might be used to the way that your church interprets some Bible passages, and you might not know that there are other interpretations. Example: When you are translating the word \\u201cbaptize,\\u201d you might want to translate it with a word that means \\u201csprinkle\\u201d because that is what your church does. But after reading unfoldingWord\\u00ae Translation Words, you learn that the word has a meaning in the range of \\u201cplunge,\\u201d \\u201cdip,\\u201d \\u201cwash,\\u201d or \\u201cpurify.\\u201d\\n\\n2.) You might want to translate a Bible passage in a way that accords with your culture rather than according with what it meant when it was written.  Example: It is common in North American culture for women to speak and preach in churches. A translator from that culture might be tempted to translate the words of 1 Corinthians 14:34a in a way that is not as strict as the Apostle Paul wrote them: \\u201cLet the women be silent in the churches.\\u201d But a faithful translator will translate the meaning of the Bible passage just the way it is.\\n\\n3.) You might not like something that the Bible says, and you might be tempted to change it. Example: You might not like what Jesus says in John 6:53, \\u201cTruly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves.\\u201d This may seem disgusting to you, but you must translate it faithfully so that your people can read it and contemplate what Jesus meant by it.\\n\\n4.) You might be afraid of what others in your village will think or do if they read a faithful translation of what the Bible says. Example: You might be tempted to translate God\\u2019s words in Matthew 3:17, \\u201cThis is my beloved Son. I am very pleased with him,\\u201d with a word that does not mean \\u201cson.\\u201d But you must remember that you do not have the right to change the meaning of what the Bible says.\\n\\n5.) You might know something extra about the Bible passage that you are translating, and you might want to add that to your translation. Example: When you are translating Mark 10:11, \\u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her,\\u201d you might know that in Matthew 19:9 there is also the phrase, \\u201c\\u2026 except for sexual immorality \\u2026.\\u201d Even so, do not add this phrase into Mark 10:11 because that would not be translating faithfully. Also, do not add any of your own ideas or any teachings from your church. Only translate the meaning that is there in the Bible passage.\"}",

    "document_text": "\n# The 6 FIA steps of drafting\n\n## INTRODUCTION\nCreating a translation draft is like making good food (like a cake). To make a good meal, you need to have certain ingredients (to make a cake, you just need flour, eggs, and sugar). In the same way, we need some basic ingredients to make a good translation draft. We call these ingredients  familiarization,  internalization, and articulation,  or  \"FIA.\"\n- Familiarization  helps a translation team know everything  in a passage very well (if appropriate, touch your head here).\n- Internalization  helps the team move that knowledge  to their heart so they understand the passage deeply (if appropriate, touch your heart here).\n- Articulation  helps the translation team begin to decide  how to translate a passage and practice expressing the passage in their own language (if appropriate, spread out your hands here).\n\nMaking good food also requires you to do certain things and follow a certain process. In the same way, the FIA steps have teams do specific activities and follow a specific process to create a translation draft. The activities and steps in the FIA process help make sure that the translation team:\n- Has all the information they need to know in order to translate that passage of scripture.\n- Deeply understands a passage of scripture so they can translate it well.\n- Has lots of practice in expressing the passage in their language\n\t\n\t\n## FIA Step #1:  Head and Heart\nIn this step, the idea is to hear the pass and put the passage in one's heart. Translators will watch or list the passage in a language of wider communication and in as many translations as they can. Then they will discuss the passage.\n\nFirst, listen to an audio version of the passage three times, in three different translations, if possible. Then, as a group, discuss the following questions. \n1. What do you like in this passage?\n2. What do you not like or not understand in this passage?\n3. What does this passage tell us about Jesus?\n4. What does this passage tell us about people?\n5. How does this passage affect our daily lives?\n6. Whho do you know who needs to hear this passage?\n\n## FIA Step #2:  Setting the Stage\nIn this step, translators will listen or watch the whole context of a passage. This context might be historical, cultural, linguistic, or geographical. Here, the translation team might look at pictures and maps to help them understand the context of the passage. The team will discuss some of that context as a group and talk about how that context relates to their own culture.\n\n## FIA Step #3:  Defining the Scenes\nIn this step the translators will hear about the different scenes and characters in a passage. They will visualize the scenes by drawing, storyboarding, or using random objects to show the different scenes and action in the passage.\n\n## FIA Step #4:  Embodying the Text\nIn this step, the translators act out the story two times. The first time, they act out the story without stopping. The second time, they stop at different points in the story and discuss what different characters might be feeling or thinking in the story.\n\n## FIA Step #5:  Filling the Gaps\nIn this step the translators focus on the specific words and key terms in the story. They discuss how they say things in their language, and begin to choose how they translate certain words and phrases.\n\n## FIA Step #6:  Signing or Speaking the Word\nIn this step the translation team will practice signing or speaking the passage. As a group, they will talk about the different words and phrases they will use  when they create a draft of the passage. \n",

While he was standing there, a strong windstorm struck the mountain. As a result, rocks were loosened from the mountainside. But Yahweh was not in the wind. Then there was an earthquake, but Yahweh was not in the earthquake. Then there was a fire, but Yahweh was not in the fire. Then there was a sound like someone whispering quietly. When Elijah heard that, he wrapped his cloak around his face. He went out of the cave and stood at its entrance. And he heard Yahweh speaking to him, saying again, \u201cElijah, why are you here?\u201d He replied again, \u201cI have zealously served you, Yahweh, commander of angel armies. But the Israelite people have rejected the agreement that they made with you. They have torn down your altars, and they have killed all of your prophets. I am the only one whom they have not killed, and now they are trying to kill me, too. So I am running away from them.\u201d Then Yahweh told him, \u201cGo back to the wilderness near Damascus. When you arrive there anoint with olive oil a man named Hazael, to appoint him to be the king of Aram. Then anoint Jehu son of Nimshi to be the king of Israel, and also anoint Elisha son of Shaphat, from the city of Abel Meholah, to become my prophet after you are gone. Hazael\u2019s army will kill many people, and those who escape from being killed by his army will be killed by Jehu\u2019s army, and those who escape from being killed by Jehu\u2019s army will be killed by Elisha. But you need to know that there are still seven thousand people in Israel who have never bowed to worship Baal or kissed his idol.\u201d",

In translating Genesis 1:7-9, several noteworthy challenges arise, particularly regarding the clarity and consistency of terms and grammatical structures within the context of Creation. Here is a detailed guide to help navigate these:

In Genesis 1:7, there is a repeated expression of God's creation of the "expanse." It's essential to ensure that your translation clarifies this process, so it does not sound like God created the expanse twice. Consider using translations like "In that way God made" or "That is how he made" to accurately reflect the sequential narrative (verse 7). The original Hebrew term for "expanse" (◊î÷∏◊®÷∏◊ß÷¥◊ô◊¢÷∑) can also be translated as "a vast space," which should be consistent across related verses (1:6, 1:8). 

The phrase "separated between the waters" may be translated with variations that better suit the grammatical structure of the target language, such as "and divided" or "and used it to separate." When referring to "the waters" that are above and below, consider whether replacing these with pronouns (e.g., "it") enhances readability and naturalness according to the conventions of the target language. This should remain clear to maintain the imagery of separation.

In Genesis 1:8, the expanse being called "Heavens" requires consistency with how you rendered this term in previous verses (e.g., 1:1). The term likely refers both to the atmosphere and beyond into space, where celestial bodies exist. As for the phrase "there was evening, and there was morning," align it with previous translations (1:5), potentially translating it as "Then evening came, and then morning came." Additionally, consider cultural preferences for expressing "the second day"‚Äîwhether an ordinal ("second") or cardinal number ("day two") feels more natural.

Genesis 1:9 introduces verbs that may be expressed in either passive or active forms, depending on what aligns better with your language‚Äôs conventions. The verb "be gathered" could alternatively be expressed actively, as in "Let the water that is under the sky come together." Also, the notion of "dry ground appearing" requires careful rendering: ensure it reads as the land becoming visible after water recedes, not as if the land was already dry under the water. Suitable translations might include "so that dry land can be seen." 

As a concluding note for verse 9, as you express "And it was so," align this with earlier expressions (1:7) for narrative coherence, such as "And it was exactly as God commanded it to be."

These guidelines should help maintain clarity, consistency, and readability for these verses in your translation of Genesis.

In Genesis 1:10-14, translators face several challenges due to the intricacies of Hebrew expressions and the need to convey clear meanings.

In verse 10, the term translated as "Land" originates from the Hebrew word often rendered as "earth," but here it specifically refers to dry ground. It contrasts with "Seas," which could imply one large body of water, suggesting translation options such as "Ocean" or "Sea." It's also necessary to consider languages that need more specificity instead of pronouns, thus instead of "it was good," you might translate "that what he had made was good."

For verse 11, "vegetation" refers to all kinds of green plants, which is broader than it might seem; it includes plants with edible seeds like rice or wheat. The phrase "according to its kind" emphasizes that each species produces its own type and should be clearly distinguished. Depending on your language, the placement of elements like "throughout the earth" might vary for clarity and flow.

Verse 12 reiterates the action taken by "the land" as commanded by God. It's essential to ensure that it doesn't imply plants were created twice. Descriptions of plant and tree reproduction should reflect their specific types, again using the phrase "according to its kind." The appraisal of the creation as "good" should consider previous translations if specific reference or further description is needed.

In verse 13, the recurring structure of mentioning evening and morning should reflect how you've handled similar phrases earlier, such as in verses 5 and 8. This maintains consistency in how the days of creation are concluded.

Verse 14 presents a more conceptual challenge with "lights in the expanse of the heavens." While these lights are the sun, moon, and stars, translations should avoid prematurely specifying these elements, retaining the general sense as in the original text. "The expanse of the heavens" might require simplification depending on the natural expression in your language, potentially shortening it to something like "in the sky." Additionally, the lights serve roles beyond illumination‚Äîthey mark time and seasons, so capturing this multifunctionality is crucial.

By focusing on these translation aspects and considering both lexical choices and sentence structure, you can provide a clear and faithful rendering of this passage.

The passage in Matthew 1:1-2 begins the genealogy of Jesus Christ, linking Him to significant figures in Jewish history. It establishes Jesus as a descendant of David and Abraham, highlighting His royal and covenantal lineage. The text traces the line from Abraham to Isaac, then to Jacob, and finally to Judah and his brothers, setting the stage for the broader genealogical record to follow. This introduction underscores Jesus' connection to key patriarchs, grounding His identity within the heritage of Israel.

Would you like me to summarize Matthew 1:3-7 next?

The passage from Matthew 1:3-7 outlines part of the genealogy of Jesus, tracing the lineage from Judah to King David and then to King Solomon. Judah is the father of Perez and Zerah, with Tamar as their mother, and Perez is followed by Hezron and then Ram. Ram's lineage continues to Amminadab, Nahshon, and Salmon, who is noted as the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz fathers Obed with Ruth, and Obed is followed by Jesse, who fathers David, the king. David then fathers Solomon with the wife of Uriah. The line continues with Solomon's son Rehoboam, followed by Abijah and Asa. This genealogy emphasizes key ancestral figures in the line leading to Jesus, linking him to Israel's royal heritage.

In Genesis 1:1-5, translators face several key challenges related to the original Hebrew expressions and their cultural or theological implications. Here are some important considerations:

**Genesis 1:1** presents the opening phrase "In the beginning," which in Hebrew is "◊ë÷º÷∞‚Å†◊®÷µ◊ê◊©◊Å÷¥÷ñ◊ô◊™." Some languages may require a verb like ‚Äúbegan‚Äù instead of the abstract noun ‚Äúbeginning.‚Äù Thus, an alternate translation could be ‚ÄúAt the beginning of time.‚Äù

The verb "create" (◊ë÷º÷∏◊®÷∏÷£◊ê) refers to an activity only God does, often implying creation out of nothing. Ensure your translation reflects this unique divine act, possibly using ‚Äúmade‚Äù while emphasizing the concept of creation from nothing.

‚ÄúThe heavens and the earth‚Äù can be translated as ‚Äúthe sky‚Äù for the heavens (◊ê÷µ÷•◊™ ◊î÷∑‚Å†◊©◊Å÷º÷∏◊û÷∑÷ñ◊ô÷¥◊ù), and the earth (◊ï÷∞‚Å†◊ê÷µ÷•◊™ ◊î÷∏‚Å†◊ê÷∏÷Ω◊®÷∂◊•) refers specifically to planet Earth. Ensure consistency if these terms are translated differently in your language.

**Genesis 1:2** uses the Hebrew phrase for "formless and empty" (◊î÷∏◊ô÷∞◊™÷∏÷•◊î ◊™÷π÷®◊î◊ï÷º÷ô ◊ï÷∏‚Å†◊ë÷π÷î◊î◊ï÷º). It's important to keep both terms, as they indicate a lack of present form and the absence of life, rather than condensing them into one concept like ‚Äúdesolate.‚Äù 

The ‚Äúdeep waters‚Äù and ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù (◊ï÷∞‚Å†◊ó÷π÷ñ◊©◊Å÷∂◊ö÷∞ ◊¢÷∑◊ú÷æ◊§÷º÷∞◊†÷µ÷£◊ô ◊™÷∞◊î÷ë◊ï÷π◊ù) describe a primordial state covered in darkness and water. Alternate phrases might include ‚Äú[It was completely dark, there was deep water everywhere].‚Äù

The phrase ‚ÄúSpirit of God‚Äù (◊ï÷∞‚Å†◊®÷£◊ï÷º◊ó÷∑ ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥÷î◊ô◊ù) can be seen as God's Spirit hovering or as ‚Äúa wind from God blowing.‚Äù Choose according to theological context and linguistic norms.

**Genesis 1:3** records God‚Äôs command "Let there be light" (◊ô÷∞◊î÷¥÷£◊ô ◊ê÷ë◊ï÷π◊®), a direct command rather than permission or suggestion. If using an exclamation point, avoid implying anger, focusing instead on the authoritative nature of the command.

**Genesis 1:4** mentions God seeing the light as ‚Äúgood‚Äù (◊ê÷∂◊™÷æ◊î÷∏‚Å†◊ê÷ñ◊ï÷π◊® ◊õ÷º÷¥◊ô÷æ◊ò÷ë◊ï÷π◊ë). Here, ‚Äúgood‚Äù denotes quality, completeness, and the absence of sin, reflecting God‚Äôs character. Ensure your translation notes these aspects rather than simply being about God‚Äôs satisfaction.

The separation of light from darkness (◊ï÷∑‚Å†◊ô÷º÷∑◊ë÷∞◊ì÷º÷µ÷£◊ú ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥÷î◊ô◊ù) involves creating distinct periods for day and night. Translate this as assigning time for light and darkness, such as ‚ÄúHe caused the light to have its own time.‚Äù

**Genesis 1:5** uses the terms ‚ÄúDay‚Äù and ‚ÄúNight‚Äù (◊ú÷∏‚Å†◊ê◊ï÷π◊®÷ô ◊ô÷î◊ï÷π◊ù) for times of light and darkness. Ensure clarity that ‚ÄúDay‚Äù here refers only to daylight hours, not a 24-hour period.

The progression to evening and morning (◊ï÷∑÷Ω‚Å†◊ô÷∞◊î÷¥◊ô÷æ◊¢÷∂÷•◊®÷∂◊ë ◊ï÷∑÷Ω‚Å†◊ô÷∞◊î÷¥◊ô÷æ◊ë÷π÷ñ◊ß÷∂◊®) needs to imply a sequence rather than simultaneity. Consider using ‚ÄúThen evening came, and then morning came.‚Äù

Finally, "one day" (◊ô÷•◊ï÷π◊ù ◊ê÷∂◊ó÷∏÷Ω◊ì) is expressed with a cardinal number in Hebrew, though other days use ordinals. You may choose either ongoing cardinals for uniformity or switch to ordinals, such as ‚Äúfirst day,‚Äù depending on your language.

By considering these translation decisions, you can ensure a coherent and faithful rendering of this foundational text.

The separation of light from darkness (◊ï÷∑‚Å†◊ô÷º÷∑◊ë÷∞◊ì÷º÷µ÷£◊ú ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥÷î◊ô◊ù) involves creating distinct periods for day and night. Translate this as assigning time for light and darkness, such as ‚ÄúHe caused the light to have its own time.‚Äù

**Genesis 1:5** uses the terms ‚ÄúDay‚Äù and ‚ÄúNight‚Äù (◊ú÷∏‚Å†◊ê◊ï÷π◊®÷ô ◊ô÷î◊ï÷π◊ù) for times of light and darkness. Ensure clarity that ‚ÄúDay‚Äù here refers only to daylight hours, not a 24-hour period.

The progression to evening and morning (◊ï÷∑÷Ω‚Å†◊ô÷∞◊î÷¥◊ô÷æ◊¢÷∂÷•◊®÷∂◊ë ◊ï÷∑÷Ω‚Å†◊ô÷∞◊î÷¥◊ô÷æ◊ë÷π÷ñ◊ß÷∂◊®) needs to imply a sequence rather than simultaneity. Consider using ‚ÄúThen evening came, and then morning came.‚Äù

Finally, "one day" (◊ô÷•◊ï÷π◊ù ◊ê÷∂◊ó÷∏÷Ω◊ì) is expressed with a cardinal number in Hebrew, though other days use ordinals. You may choose either ongoing cardinals for uniformity or switch to ordinals, such as ‚Äúfirst day,‚Äù depending on your language.

By considering these translation decisions, you can ensure a coherent and faithful rendering of this foundational text.

3) Translation helps (e.g., 'Translation challenges for John 1:1?')

I am very pleased with him.\\u201d (Matthew 3:16-17 ULT)'\\n\\nThe Bible shows that Jesus called God his Father: 'Jesus \\u2026 said, \\u201cI praise you Father, Lord of heaven and earth \\u2026 no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son.\\u201d (Matthew 11:25a, 27b ULT) (See also: John 6:26-57)'\\n\\nChristians have found that \\u201cFather\\u201d and \\u201cSon\\u201d are the ideas that most essentially describe the eternal relationship of the First and Second Persons of the Trinity to each other. The Bible indeed refers to them in various ways, but no other terms reflect the eternal love and intimacy between these Persons, nor the interdependent eternal relationship between them.\\n\\nJesus referred to God in the following terms: 'Baptize them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19b ULT)'\\n\\nThe intimate, loving relationship between the Father and the Son is eternal, just as they are eternal. The Father loves the Son. (See John 3:35-36; 5:19-20 ULT)\\n\\nI love the Father, and just as the Father commanded me, thus I do. (John 14:31 ULT)\\n\\nNo one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son. (Luke 10:22b ULT)\\n\\nThe terms \\u201cFather\\u201d and \\u201cSon\\u201d also communicate that the Father and the Son are of the same essence; they are both eternal God.\\n\\nJesus said, \\u201cFather, \\u2026 glorify your Son so that the Son will glorify you \\u2026 I glorified you on the earth \\u2026 Now Father, glorify me \\u2026 with the glory that I had with you before the world was made.\\u201d (John 17:1, 4a, 5 ULT)\\n\\nBut in these last days, {God the Father} has spoken to us through a Son, whom he appointed to be the heir of all things. Through him, he also made the universe. He is the brightness of God\\u2019s glory and the very exact representation of his being. He holds everything together by the word of his power. (Hebrews 1:2-3a ULT)\\n\\nJesus said to him, \\u201cI have been with you for so long and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, \\u2018Show us the Father\\u2019?\\u201d (John 14:9 ULT)\\n\\nHuman Relationships\\n\\nHuman fathers and sons are not perfect, but the Bible still uses those terms for the Father and Son, who are perfect.\\n\\nJust as today, human father-son relationships during Bible times were never as loving or perfect as the relationship between Jesus and his Father. But this does not mean that the translator should avoid the concepts of father and son. The Scriptures use these terms to refer to God, the perfect Father and Son, as well as to sinful human fathers and sons. In referring to God as Father and Son, choose words in your language that are widely used to refer to a human \\u201cfather\\u201d and \\u201cson.\\u201d In this way you will communicate that God the Father and God the Son are of the same divine essence (they are both God), just as a human father and son are of the same human essence (they are both human and share the same human characteristics).\\n\\nTranslation Strategies\\n\\n(1) Think through all the possibilities within your language to translate the words \\u201cson\\u201d and \\u201cfather.\\u201d Determine which words in your language best represent the divine \\u201cSon\\u201d and \\u201cFather.\\u201d (2) If your language has more than one word for \\u201cson,\\u201d use the word that has the closest meaning to \\u201conly son\\u201d (or \\u201cfirst son\\u201d if necessary). (3) If your language has more than one word for \\u201cfather,\\u201d use the word that has the closest meaning to \\u201cbirth father,\\u201d rather than \\u201cadoptive father.\\u201d\"}",

What are some suggestions for how I might translate Bible verses stating that Jesus is the Son of God in ways that are faithful, but also without being culturally offensive?\"], \"article_body\": \"Create Faithful Translations\\n\\nFaithful Translations\\n\\nTo make a translation that is faithful to the Bible, you must avoid any political, denominational, ideological, social, cultural, or theological bias in your translation. Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Use equivalent common language terms for the biblical words that describe the relationship between God the Father and God the Son. These may be clarified, as needed, in footnotes or other supplemental resources.\\n\\nYour goal as a Bible translator is to communicate the same message that the original writer of the Bible intended to communicate. This means that you should not try to communicate your own message, or the message that you think the Bible should say, or that your church thinks the Bible should say. For any Bible passage, you must communicate what it says, all of what it says, and only what it says. You must resist the temptation to put any of your own interpretations or messages into the Bible. Do not add any meaning to the message that is not already there in the Bible passage. (The message of a Bible passage includes the implied information.\\n\\nYou must also use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Read the definitions of the unfoldingWord\\u00ae Translation Words to make sure that you understand the meanings of these words. Translate so that these key terms have these same meanings, and do not translate them in different ways just to please your pastor, your village leaders, or yourself.\\n\\nAlways translating faithfully can be difficult for several reasons:\\n\\n1.) You might be used to the way that your church interprets some Bible passages, and you might not know that there are other interpretations. Example: When you are translating the word \\u201cbaptize,\\u201d you might want to translate it with a word that means \\u201csprinkle\\u201d because that is what your church does. But after reading unfoldingWord\\u00ae Translation Words, you learn that the word has a meaning in the range of \\u201cplunge,\\u201d \\u201cdip,\\u201d \\u201cwash,\\u201d or \\u201cpurify.\\u201d\\n\\n2.) You might want to translate a Bible passage in a way that accords with your culture rather than according with what it meant when it was written.  Example: It is common in North American culture for women to speak and preach in churches. A translator from that culture might be tempted to translate the words of 1 Corinthians 14:34a in a way that is not as strict as the Apostle Paul wrote them: \\u201cLet the women be silent in the churches.\\u201d But a faithful translator will translate the meaning of the Bible passage just the way it is.\\n\\n3.) You might not like something that the Bible says, and you might be tempted to change it. Example: You might not like what Jesus says in John 6:53, \\u201cTruly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves.\\u201d This may seem disgusting to you, but you must translate it faithfully so that your people can read it and contemplate what Jesus meant by it.\\n\\n4.) You might be afraid of what others in your village will think or do if they read a faithful translation of what the Bible says. Example: You might be tempted to translate God\\u2019s words in Matthew 3:17, \\u201cThis is my beloved Son.

Also, do not add any of your own ideas or any teachings from your church. Only translate the meaning that is there in the Bible passage.\"}",

To make a good meal, you need to have certain ingredients (to make a cake, you just need flour, eggs, and sugar). In the same way, we need some basic ingredients to make a good translation draft. We call these ingredients  familiarization,  internalization, and articulation,  or  \"FIA.\"\n- Familiarization  helps a translation team know everything  in a passage very well (if appropriate, touch your head here).\n- Internalization  helps the team move that knowledge  to their heart so they understand the passage deeply (if appropriate, touch your heart here).\n- Articulation  helps the translation team begin to decide  how to translate a passage and practice expressing the passage in their own language (if appropriate, spread out your hands here).\n\nMaking good food also requires you to do certain things and follow a certain process. In the same way, the FIA steps have teams do specific activities and follow a specific process to create a translation draft. The activities and steps in the FIA process help make sure that the translation team:\n- Has all the information they need to know in order to translate that passage of scripture.\n- Deeply understands a passage of scripture so they can translate it well.\n- Has lots of practice in expressing the passage in their language\n\t\n\t\n## FIA Step #1:  Head and Heart\nIn this step, the idea is to hear the pass and put the passage in one's heart. Translators will watch or list the passage in a language of wider communication and in as many translations as they can. Then they will discuss the passage.\n\nFirst, listen to an audio version of the passage three times, in three different translations, if possible. Then, as a group, discuss the following questions. \n1. What do you like in this passage?\n2. What do you not like or not understand in this passage?\n3. What does this passage tell us about Jesus?\n4. What does this passage tell us about people?\n5. How does this passage affect our daily lives?\n6. Whho do you know who needs to hear this passage?\n\n## FIA Step #2:  Setting the Stage\nIn this step, translators will listen or watch the whole context of a passage. This context might be historical, cultural, linguistic, or geographical. Here, the translation team might look at pictures and maps to help them understand the context of the passage. The team will discuss some of that context as a group and talk about how that context relates to their own culture.\n\n## FIA Step #3:  Defining the Scenes\nIn this step the translators will hear about the different scenes and characters in a passage. They will visualize the scenes by drawing, storyboarding, or using random objects to show the different scenes and action in the passage.\n\n## FIA Step #4:  Embodying the Text\nIn this step, the translators act out the story two times. The first time, they act out the story without stopping. The second time, they stop at different points in the story and discuss what different characters might be feeling or thinking in the story.\n\n## FIA Step #5:  Filling the Gaps\nIn this step the translators focus on the specific words and key terms in the story. They discuss how they say things in their language, and begin to choose how they translate certain words and phrases.\n\n## FIA Step #6:  Signing or Speaking the Word\nIn this step the translation team will practice signing or speaking the passage. As a group, they will talk about the different words and phrases they will use  when they create a draft of the passage. \n",

    "document_text": "# ELIJAH\r\n\r\n1. Ninth-century BC prophet of Israel. Elijah\u2019s name means \u201cmy God is the Lord\u201d\u2014appropriate for a stalwart opponent of Baal worship. The Scriptures give no information regarding his family background except that he was a Tishbite who probably came from the land of Gilead on the east bank of the Jordan River. He lived primarily during the reigns of kings Ahab (874\u2013853 BC) and Ahaziah (853\u2013852 BC) of Israel. The biblical account of Elijah runs from 1\u00a0Kings 17 to 2\u00a0Kings 2.\r\n\r\nElijah was called by God at a critical period in Israel\u2019s life. Economically and politically the northern kingdom was in its strongest position since its separation from the southern kingdom. Omri (885\u2013874 BC) had initiated a policy of trade and friendly relations with the Phoenicians. To show his good faith, Omri gave his son Ahab in marriage to Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of Tyre. She brought Baal worship with her to Israel, a false religion whose rapid spread soon threatened the kingdom\u2019s very existence. Elijah was sent to turn the nation and its leaders back to the Lord through his prophetic message and miracles.\r\n\r\n## Warning of Drought\r\n\r\nElijah began his recorded ministry by telling Ahab that the nation would suffer a drought until the prophet himself announced its end (1\u00a0Kgs 17:1). He thus repeated Moses\u2019 warning (Lv 26:14-39; Dt 28:15-68) of the consequences of turning away from God.\r\n\r\nElijah then hid himself in a ravine on the east bank of the Jordan River by the brook Cherith (possibly the valley of the Yarmuk River in north Gilead). There he had sufficient water for his needs, and ravens brought him food twice daily. When the brook dried up, Elijah was directed to move to the Phoenician village of Zarephath near Sidon. A widow took care of him from her scanty supplies, and her obedience to Elijah was rewarded by a miraculous supply of meal and oil that was not depleted until the drought ended.\r\n\r\nWhile Elijah was staying with the widow, her son became ill and died. By the power of prayer, the child was restored to life and good health.\r\n\r\nIn the drought\u2019s third year the Lord told Elijah to inform Ahab that God would soon provide rain for Israel. On his return, Elijah first encountered Ahab\u2019s officer, Obadiah, who was searching for water for the king\u2019s livestock. Elijah sent Obadiah to arrange a meeting with Ahab. At first Obadiah refused. For three years Ahab had searched Israel and the neighboring kingdoms in vain for the prophet, no doubt in order to force him to end the drought. Obadiah was certain that while he went to bring Ahab, Israel\u2019s most wanted \u201coutlaw\u201d would elude them again, thus enraging the king. When Elijah promised him that he would stay until he returned, the officer arranged for Ahab to meet the prophet.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent meeting Elijah rejected the king\u2019s allegation that he was the \u201ctroubler of Israel\u201d (1\u00a0Kgs 18:17-18). He was only obeying God, he insisted, in pointing out Ahab\u2019s idolatry. Ahab had even permitted Jezebel to subsidize a school of Baal and Asherah prophets. Elijah then requested a public gathering on Mt Carmel as a contest between the prophets of Baal and the prophets of the Lord to determine who was the true God.\r\n\r\n## Confrontation on Carmel\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights of Elijah\u2019s ministry was the contest on Mt Carmel. Ahab assembled all Israel along with 850 prophets of Baal and Asherah. The famous challenge was issued: \u201cHow long are you going to waver between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him! But if Baal is God, then follow him!\u201d (1\u00a0Kgs 18:21, nlt). Sacrificial animals were to be placed on two altars, one for Baal and one for the Lord, and the prophets representing each were to ask for fire from their God.\r\n\r\nAll day long the pagan prophets called in vain on Baal. They danced a whirling, frenzied dance, cutting themselves with knives until their blood gushed. But there was no answer. Finally, Elijah\u2019s turn came. He repaired the demolished altar of the Lord and prepared the sacrifice. For dramatic effect, he built a trench around the altar and poured water over the sacrifice until the trench overflowed. Then he said a brief prayer, and immediately fire fell from heaven and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench (1\u00a0Kgs 18:38).\r\n\r\nWhen the people saw it, they fell on their faces in repentance, chanting, \u201cThe Lord is God! The Lord is God!\u201d (1\u00a0Kgs 18:39). At Elijah\u2019s command the people seized the prophets of Baal and killed them by the brook Kishon. Then Elijah, at the top of Carmel, began to pray fervently for rain. Dramatically, the sky became black with clouds and rain began to pour, ending the long drought. Ahab rode back in his chariot to Jezreel, 20 miles (32.2\u00a0kilometers) to the east. God\u2019s Spirit enabled Elijah to outrun Ahab, and he arrived in Jezreel first.\r\n\r\nJezebel, furious over the massacre of the Baal prophets, sent a message to Elijah: \u201cMay the gods also kill me if by this time tomorrow I have failed to take your life like those whom you killed\u201d (1\u00a0Kgs 19:2, nlt). When Elijah received her message, he panicked and fled to Beersheba.\r\n\r\n## Experience at Horeb\r\n\r\nElijah left his servant in Beersheba, going another day\u2019s journey into the desert alone. There he lay down under a broom tree and, in despair and exhaustion, asked God to take his life. Instead, an angel appeared, nourishing him twice with bread and water. After he had slept, Elijah continued on\u00a0his way.\r\n\r\nAfter 40 days, Elijah arrived at Mt Horeb, where he found shelter in a cave. There the Lord spoke to him, asking what he was doing there. The prophet explained that he was the only prophet of God left in Israel, and now even his life was threatened. In response, the mighty forces of nature\u2014a great wind, an earthquake, and fire\u2014were displayed before Elijah to show him that the omnipotent God could intercede on his behalf with a powerful hand. Finally God encouraged Elijah in a \u201cstill, small voice.\u201d The Lord had further tasks for him to accomplish. God also told Elijah that he was not the only faithful person in Israel; 7,000 others remained true to the Lord.\r\n\r\nSince Elijah had faithfully delivered God\u2019s message to Ahab, the Lord commissioned him to deliver another message, one of judgment on Israel\u2019s continuing failure to listen to God. The instruments of retribution were to be Hazael, who would become king in Syria (c. 893\u2013796 BC), and Jehu, who would become king of Israel (841\u2013814 BC). Elijah was instructed to anoint both of them. He was also told to anoint his successor, Elisha, to be his understudy until it was time for Elisha\u2019s full ministry to begin.\r\n\r\n## Confrontation concerning Naboth\r\n\r\nAfter his return to Israel, one of Elijah\u2019s boldest confrontations with King Ahab was over Naboth\u2019s vineyard. Although Ahab wanted Naboth\u2019s property, he was sensitive to the law regarding ownership of land. Further, Ahab never completely abandoned the faith of his fathers (1\u00a0Kgs 21:27-29). Jezebel, however, had no regard for the Mosaic law and conspired to have Naboth put to death on a false charge.\r\n\r\nWhen Ahab then took possession of the vineyard, Elijah branded him as a murderer and a robber. He predicted divine judgment\u2014the fall of Ahab\u2019s dynasty and Jezebel\u2019s horrible death (1\u00a0Kgs 21:17-24). Ahab repented, however, and the judgment was postponed.\r\n\r\n## Ahaziah\u2019s Folly\r\n\r\nThe Lord\u2019s judgment on Ahab was finally executed when the king was killed in a battle with Syria in 853 BC. The dogs licked up Ahab\u2019s blood, as the prophet had predicted (1\u00a0Kgs 21:19). Shortly after Ahaziah had succeeded his father as king, he suffered a crippling fall. While lying ill, he sent messengers to ask Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether he would recover. The Lord sent Elijah to intercept them and give them a message for the king: a rebuke for ignoring the God of Israel and a warning of the king\u2019s impending death.\r\n\r\nAhaziah angrily sent a captain with 50 soldiers to arrest Elijah. They were consumed by fire from heaven at Elijah\u2019s words. A second captain and another 50 soldiers were sent but met the same fate. The third captain who came begged the prophet to spare his and his soldiers\u2019 lives. Elijah went with this captain and delivered God\u2019s message to the king personally. The king would not recover but would die because he had inquired from pagan gods rather than from the true God.\r\n\r\n## Warning to Jehoram\r\n\r\nElijah had been called primarily to minister to Israel, but he also delivered God\u2019s word of warning to Jehoram, king of Judah, rebuking him for following Israel in its idolatry and for not walking in the godly ways of his father and grandfather (2\u00a0Chr 21:12-15).\r\n\r\n## Elijah\u2019s Ascent into Heaven\r\n\r\nWhen the end of Elijah\u2019s ministry drew near, Elisha refused to leave him. After a journey that took them to schools of the prophets at Bethel and Jericho, the two crossed the Jordan River miraculously; Elijah struck the waters with his mantle and they parted. Elisha requested a double portion (the firstborn\u2019s share, cf. Dt 21:17) of his master\u2019s spirit, for he desired to be Elijah\u2019s full successor. Elisha knew his request was granted because he saw Elijah pass into the heavens in a whirlwind bearing a chariot and horses of fire. The young prophets who had accompanied Elisha searched in vain for Elijah in the mountains and valleys around the Jordan; God had taken his faithful prophet home. Elijah thus joined Enoch as the only other man in the Bible who did not experience death.\r\n\r\n## Elijah\u2019s Message and Miracles\r\n\r\nAs the Baal worship of Tyre made inroads into Israel through Jezebel, Elijah was sent to check its spread by emphasizing again that Israel\u2019s God was the only God of the whole earth. He began a vital work that was continued by Jehu, who slaughtered many of the Baal worshipers among Israel\u2019s leaders (2\u00a0Kgs 10:18-28). Elijah\u2019s specific mission was to destroy heathen worship in order to spare Israel, thus preparing the way for the prophets who were to follow in his spirit.\r\n\r\nMiracles were prominent in Elijah\u2019s ministry, given as a sign to confirm him as God\u2019s spokesman and to turn Israel\u2019s kings back to God. Some scholars have rejected these miracles or tried to explain them away. The OT, however, clearly testifies to their validity, and the NT affirms them.\r\n\r\n## Elijah and the New Testament\r\n\r\nMalachi named Elijah as the forerunner of the \u201cgreat and terrible day of the Lord\u201d who will \u201cturn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers\u201d (Mal 4:5-6). Jewish writers have often taken up the same theme in their literature: Elijah will \u201crestore the tribes of Jacob\u201d (Ecclus 48:10); he is mentioned in the Qumran *Manual of Discipline* of the Dead Sea Scrolls; he is the central sign of the resurrection of the dead according to the Mishnah, the collection of Jewish oral law; and he is the subject of songs sung at the close of the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nIn the NT, Malachi\u2019s prophecy was interpreted in the angelic annunciation to Zechariah as pointing to John the Baptist, who was to do the work of another Elijah (Lk 1:17, kjv \u201cElias\u201d) and was confirmed by Jesus himself (Mt 11:14; 17:10-13).\r\n\r\nJesus also alluded to Elijah\u2019s sojourn in the land of Sidon (Lk 4:25-26), and the apostle Paul referred to the prophet\u2019s experience at Mt Horeb (Rom 11:2). The apostle James used Elijah to illustrate what it means to be a righteous man and a man of prayer (Jas 5:17).\r\n\r\nElijah appeared again on the Mt of Transfiguration with Moses as they discussed Jesus\u2019 approaching death (Mt 17:1-13; Lk 9:28-36). Some Bible scholars believe that Elijah will return as one of the two witnesses of the end times (Rv 11:3-12), in fulfillment of Malachi\u2019s prophecy that he is to come before the dreadful judgment day of God.\r\n\r\n2. Chief of Benjamin\u2019s tribe (1\u00a0Chr 8:27, kjv \u201cEliah\u201d).\r\n\r\n3. Priest who married a gentile wife (Ezr 10:21).\r\n\r\n4. Layman who also married a foreign wife (Ezr 10:26).",

[2025-10-16 02:06:12] [INFO] [bt_servant_engine.services.graph_pipeline] [cid=-]: response from openai: Elijah was a prophet in Israel during the reigns of King Ahab and Ahaziah. Here are some key points about him:

1. **Name Meaning**: His name means "my God is the Lord," reflecting his mission against Baal worship.

2. **Miracles**: God performed many miracles through Elijah, like raising a dead boy to life and calling fire from heaven.

3. **Confrontation with Ahab**: Elijah rebuked King Ahab for worshipping Baal and announced a drought in Israel as a consequence.

4. **Challenge on Mount Carmel**: Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal to a contest to prove who the true God was. God answered Elijah by sending fire from heaven, confirming His power.

5. **Mount Horeb Encounter**: After fleeing from Jezebel, Elijah experienced God's presence on Mount Horeb, where God spoke to him in a gentle whisper.

6. **Passing the Mantle**: Elijah was the mentor of Elisha, whom he anointed to succeed him as a prophet.

7. **Departure**: Elijah didn't experience death as most do; he was taken up to heaven in a whirlwind by a chariot of fire.

8. **Legacy**: Elijah's life and works are reflected in the New Testament, where John the Baptist is seen as coming in the spirit and power of Elijah.

If you would like more details on any of these points, feel free to ask!

    "document_text": "# The 6 FIA steps of drafting\n\n## INTRODUCTION\nCreating a translation draft is like making good food (like a cake). To make a good meal, you need to have certain ingredients (to make a cake, you just need flour, eggs, and sugar). In the same way, we need some basic ingredients to make a good translation draft. We call these ingredients  familiarization,  internalization, and articulation,  or  \"FIA.\"\n- Familiarization  helps a translation team know everything  in a passage very well (if appropriate, touch your head here).\n- Internalization  helps the team move that knowledge  to their heart so they understand the passage deeply (if appropriate, touch your heart here).\n- Articulation  helps the translation team begin to decide  how to translate a passage and practice expressing the passage in their own language (if appropriate, spread out your hands here).\n\nMaking good food also requires you to do certain things and follow a certain process. In the same way, the FIA steps have teams do specific activities and follow a specific process to create a translation draft. The activities and steps in the FIA process help make sure that the translation team:\n- Has all the information they need to know in order to translate that passage of scripture.\n- Deeply understands a passage of scripture so they can translate it well.\n- Has lots of practice in expressing the passage in their language\n\t\n\t\n## FIA Step #1:  Head and Heart\nIn this step, the idea is to hear the pass and put the passage in one's heart. Translators will watch or list the passage in a language of wider communication and in as many translations as they can. Then they will discuss the passage.\n\nFirst, listen to an audio version of the passage three times, in three different translations, if possible. Then, as a group, discuss the following questions. \n1. What do you like in this passage?\n2. What do you not like or not understand in this passage?\n3. What does this passage tell us about Jesus?\n4. What does this passage tell us about people?\n5. How does this passage affect our daily lives?\n6. Whho do you know who needs to hear this passage?\n\n## FIA Step #2:  Setting the Stage\nIn this step, translators will listen or watch the whole context of a passage. This context might be historical, cultural, linguistic, or geographical. Here, the translation team might look at pictures and maps to help them understand the context of the passage. The team will discuss some of that context as a group and talk about how that context relates to their own culture.\n\n## FIA Step #3:  Defining the Scenes\nIn this step the translators will hear about the different scenes and characters in a passage. They will visualize the scenes by drawing, storyboarding, or using random objects to show the different scenes and action in the passage.\n\n## FIA Step #4:  Embodying the Text\nIn this step, the translators act out the story two times. The first time, they act out the story without stopping. The second time, they stop at different points in the story and discuss what different characters might be feeling or thinking in the story.\n\n## FIA Step #5:  Filling the Gaps\nIn this step the translators focus on the specific words and key terms in the story. They discuss how they say things in their language, and begin to choose how they translate certain words and phrases.\n\n## FIA Step #6:  Signing or Speaking the Word\nIn this step the translation team will practice signing or speaking the passage. As a group, they will talk about the different words and phrases they will use  when they create a draft of the passage. "

[2025-10-16 02:07:56] [INFO] [bt_servant_engine.services.intents.fia_intents] [cid=-]: [consult-fia] response from openai: The FIA process for drafting a Bible translation involves six main steps that help ensure the translation team fully understands and accurately expresses the passage. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Step 1: Head and Heart** - The team listens to an audio version of the passage multiple times in different translations, discussing their likes, dislikes, and understanding of the passage, and reflecting on its implications for daily life.

2. **Step 2: Setting the Stage** - Translators explore the passage‚Äôs broader context, considering historical, cultural, linguistic, and geographical factors. They use tools like pictures and maps to relate the context to their own culture.

3. **Step 3: Defining the Scenes** - The team visualizes different scenes and characters within the passage using drawings, storyboards, or objects to understand the narrative deeply.

4. **Step 4: Embodying the Text** - The passage is acted out to embody the narrative fully. The first enactment is without interruption, while the second includes pauses to discuss characters' feelings and thoughts.

5. **Step 5: Filling the Gaps** - Focus is placed on specific words and key terms, discussing and deciding how to translate these effectively in the target language.

6. **Step 6: Signing or Speaking the Word** - The final step involves practicing how to orally present the passage, discussing different word choices to create a natural and cohesive draft.

This structured process ensures that translators gain a comprehensive understanding and are able to articulate the passage accurately in their own language.

This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD. Behold, with the staff in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will turn to blood. The fish in the Nile will die, the river will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink its water.‚Äô‚Äù And the LORD said to Moses, ‚ÄúTell Aaron, ‚ÄòTake your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt‚Äîover their rivers and canals and ponds and all the reservoirs‚Äîthat they may become blood.‚Äô There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in the vessels of wood and stone.‚Äù

Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded; in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials, Aaron raised the staff and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was turned to blood. The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. And there was blood throughout the land of Egypt. But the magicians of Egypt did the same things by their magic arts. So Pharaoh‚Äôs heart was hardened, and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said. Instead, Pharaoh turned around, went into his palace, and did not take any of this to heart. So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, because they could not drink the water from the river.

Would you like me to retrieve Exodus 7:25?
