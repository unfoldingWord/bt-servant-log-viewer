{"message": "Response from bt_servant: Translation helps for John 4:1-3\n\nIn translating John 4:1-3, there are several key challenges and considerations to address.\n\nFirstly, the passage starts with a lengthy sentence that might need to be divided for clarity, depending on the natural flow of your target language. In John 4:1, the sentence begins by indicating background information that sets up the following narrative. Ensure you use a form that naturally conveys such background details in your language.

I am very pleased with him.\\\\u201d (Matthew 3:16-17 ULT)'\\\\n\\\\nThe Bible shows that Jesus called God his Father: 'Jesus \\\\u2026 said, \\\\u201cI praise you Father, Lord of heaven and earth \\\\u2026 no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son.\\\\u201d (Matthew 11:25a, 27b ULT) (See also: John 6:26-57)'\\\\n\\\\nChristians have found that \\\\u201cFather\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cSon\\\\u201d are the ideas that most essentially describe the eternal relationship of the First and Second Persons of the Trinity to each other. The Bible indeed refers to them in various ways, but no other terms reflect the eternal love and intimacy between these Persons, nor the interdependent eternal relationship between them.\\\\n\\\\nJesus referred to God in the following terms: 'Baptize them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19b ULT)'\\\\n\\\\nThe intimate, loving relationship between the Father and the Son is eternal, just as they are eternal. The Father loves the Son. (See John 3:35-36; 5:19-20 ULT)\\\\n\\\\nI love the Father, and just as the Father commanded me, thus I do. (John 14:31 ULT)\\\\n\\\\nNo one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son. (Luke 10:22b ULT)\\\\n\\\\nThe terms \\\\u201cFather\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cSon\\\\u201d also communicate that the Father and the Son are of the same essence; they are both eternal God.\\\\n\\\\nJesus said, \\\\u201cFather, \\\\u2026 glorify your Son so that the Son will glorify you \\\\u2026 I glorified you on the earth \\\\u2026 Now Father, glorify me \\\\u2026 with the glory that I had with you before the world was made.\\\\u201d (John 17:1, 4a, 5 ULT)\\\\n\\\\nBut in these last days, {God the Father} has spoken to us through a Son, whom he appointed to be the heir of all things. Through him, he also made the universe. He is the brightness of God\\\\u2019s glory and the very exact representation of his being. He holds everything together by the word of his power. (Hebrews 1:2-3a ULT)\\\\n\\\\nJesus said to him, \\\\u201cI have been with you for so long and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, \\\\u2018Show us the Father\\\\u2019?\\\\u201d (John 14:9 ULT)\\\\n\\\\nHuman Relationships\\\\n\\\\nHuman fathers and sons are not perfect, but the Bible still uses those terms for the Father and Son, who are perfect.\\\\n\\\\nJust as today, human father-son relationships during Bible times were never as loving or perfect as the relationship between Jesus and his Father. But this does not mean that the translator should avoid the concepts of father and son. The Scriptures use these terms to refer to God, the perfect Father and Son, as well as to sinful human fathers and sons. In referring to God as Father and Son, choose words in your language that are widely used to refer to a human \\\\u201cfather\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cson.\\\\u201d In this way you will communicate that God the Father and God the Son are of the same divine essence (they are both God), just as a human father and son are of the same human essence (they are both human and share the same human characteristics).\\\\n\\\\nTranslation Strategies\\\\n\\\\n(1) Think through all the possibilities within your language to translate the words \\\\u201cson\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cfather.\\\\u201d Determine which words in your language best represent the divine \\\\u201cSon\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cFather.\\\\u201d (2) If your language has more than one word for \\\\u201cson,\\\\u201d use the word that has the closest meaning to \\\\u201conly son\\\\u201d (or \\\\u201cfirst son\\\\u201d if necessary). (3) If your language has more than one word for \\\\u201cfather,\\\\u201d use the word that has the closest meaning to \\\\u201cbirth father,\\\\u201d rather than \\\\u201cadoptive father.\\\\u201d\\\"}\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"source\": \"Translating Son and Father\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"collection_name\": \"knowledgebase\",\n    \"resource_name\": \"\",\n    \"source\": \"Create Faithful Translations\",\n    \"document_text\": \"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Create Faithful Translations\\\", \\\"questions_answered_by_article\\\": [\\\"What are faithful translations?\\\", \\\"I am trying to translate the Bible into a language where almost everyone is a Muslim. What are some suggestions for how I might translate Bible verses stating that Jesus is the Son of God in ways that are faithful, but also without being culturally offensive?\\\"], \\\"article_body\\\": \\\"Create Faithful Translations\\\\n\\\\nFaithful Translations\\\\n\\\\nTo make a translation that is faithful to the Bible, you must avoid any political, denominational, ideological, social, cultural, or theological bias in your translation. Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Use equivalent common language terms for the biblical words that describe the relationship between God the Father and God the Son. These may be clarified, as needed, in footnotes or other supplemental resources.\\\\n\\\\nYour goal as a Bible translator is to communicate the same message that the original writer of the Bible intended to communicate. This means that you should not try to communicate your own message, or the message that you think the Bible should say, or that your church thinks the Bible should say. For any Bible passage, you must communicate what it says, all of what it says, and only what it says. You must resist the temptation to put any of your own interpretations or messages into the Bible. Do not add any meaning to the message that is not already there in the Bible passage. (The message of a Bible passage includes the implied information.\\\\n\\\\nYou must also use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Read the definitions of the unfoldingWord\\\\u00ae Translation Words to make sure that you understand the meanings of these words. Translate so that these key terms have these same meanings, and do not translate them in different ways just to please your pastor, your village leaders, or yourself.\\\\n\\\\nAlways translating faithfully can be difficult for several reasons:\\\\n\\\\n1.) You might be used to the way that your church interprets some Bible passages, and you might not know that there are other interpretations. Example: When you are translating the word \\\\u201cbaptize,\\\\u201d you might want to translate it with a word that means \\\\u201csprinkle\\\\u201d because that is what your church does. But after reading unfoldingWord\\\\u00ae Translation Words, you learn that the word has a meaning in the range of \\\\u201cplunge,\\\\u201d \\\\u201cdip,\\\\u201d \\\\u201cwash,\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cpurify.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n2.) You might want to translate a Bible passage in a way that accords with your culture rather than according with what it meant when it was written.  Example: It is common in North American culture for women to speak and preach in churches. A translator from that culture might be tempted to translate the words of 1 Corinthians 14:34a in a way that is not as strict as the Apostle Paul wrote them: \\\\u201cLet the women be silent in the churches.\\\\u201d But a faithful translator will translate the meaning of the Bible passage just the way it is.\\\\n\\\\n3.) You might not like something that the Bible says, and you might be tempted to change it. Example: You might not like what Jesus says in John 6:53, \\\\u201cTruly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves.\\\\u201d This may seem disgusting to you, but you must translate it faithfully so that your people can read it and contemplate what Jesus meant by it.\\\\n\\\\n4.) You might be afraid of what others in your village will think or do if they read a faithful translation of what the Bible says. Example: You might be tempted to translate God\\\\u2019s words in Matthew 3:17, \\\\u201cThis is my beloved Son. I am very pleased with him,\\\\u201d with a word that does not mean \\\\u201cson.\\\\u201d But you must remember that you do not have the right to change the meaning of what the Bible says.\\\\n\\\\n5.) You might know something extra about the Bible passage that you are translating, and you might want to add that to your translation. Example: When you are translating Mark 10:11, \\\\u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her,\\\\u201d you might know that in Matthew 19:9 there is also the phrase, \\\\u201c\\\\u2026 except for sexual immorality \\\\u2026.\\\\u201d Even so, do not add this phrase into Mark 10:11 because that would not be translating faithfully. Also, do not add any of your own ideas or any teachings from your church. Only translate the meaning that is there in the Bible passage.\\\"}\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"source\": \"Create Faithful Translations\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"collection_name\": \"en_resources\",\n    \"resource_name\": \"\",\n    \"source\": \"Ahaz\",\n    \"document_text\": \"# AHAZ\\r\\n\\r\\n1. A king of Judah (735\\u2013715 BC) who was known for turning away from God. \\\"Ahaz\\\" (Matthew 1:9) is a shortened form of Ahaziah or Jehoahaz. The three main stories about Ahaz all describe him as one of the most evil kings of the southern kingdom of Judah (2\\u00a0Kings 16; 2\\u00a0Chronicles 28; Isaiah 7). He was buried without honor (2\\u00a0Chronicles 28:27). His son Hezekiah was king after him (2\\u00a0Kings 18:1).\\r\\n\\r\\n    There is little agreement on when these events happened. The dates that seem to work best suggest Ahaz became king in 735 BC. He might have ruled together with his father, Jotham, from 735 to 732 BC. If so, his whole time as king was about 20 years, ending in 715 BC.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Ahaz reigned over Judah during a dangerous time. Assyria was attacking nearby countries. Pekah, king of Israel, and Rezin, king\\u00a0of Syria, were hostile towards Assyria and invaded Judah to replace Ahaz with a king who would join their alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Instead of trusting God, Ahaz asked Tiglath-pileser III, king of Assyria, for help. This made the prophet Isaiah angry. The following war led to Isaiah\\u2019s prediction of the birth of Immanuel as a sign that Israel and Syria would be destroyed (Isaiah 7). Tiglath-pileser did destroy the two countries over the next two years, from 734 to 732 BC.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Before Israel and Syria were destroyed, their invasion of Judah caused many problems (2\\u00a0Chronicles 28:8). They took many people and things from Judah. A prophet named Obed stopped them from keeping 200,000 captives as slaves and made them return the people to Jericho. (2 Chronicles 28:9). He was joined by several leaders of Israel (2 Chronicles 28:12), who returned the prisoners to Jericho some of the spoil that was stolen.\\r\\n\\r\\n    During this time, Judah may have been attacked from the south, too. The Edomites, who Judah used to control, may have tried to become independent because Judah was getting weaker. The Hebrew Bible talks about Syria (called Aram in Hebrew) attacking the town of Elath by the Red Sea (2\\u00a0Kings 16:6). But, the name Aram is similar to the name Edom in Hebrew, so many scholars think that invasion was actually by Edomites.\\r\\n\\r\\n    By allying with Assyria, Ahaz put Judah in danger. Judah became like a slave country to Tiglath-pileser. Ahaz went to Damascus, which used to be Syria's capital, to meet Tiglath-pileser. He probably went to show that he would obey the king his country now had to pay (2\\u00a0Kings 16:10).\\r\\n\\r\\n    In Damascus, Ahaz saw an Assyrian altar. He had one like it built in Jerusalem to replace the original altar. He made other changes in the temple, showing he was turning away from Jewish religion.\\r\\n\\r\\n    The \\\"stairway of Ahaz\\\" was important in a prophecy given to his son Hezekiah (2\\u00a0Kings 20:11; Isaiah 38:8). The set of stairs was probably used to tell time by the movement of a shadow across it.\\r\\n\\r\\n    *See also* King; Kings, Books of First and Second; Israel, History of; Sundial; Timeline of the Bible (Old Testament).\\r\\n2.

{"message": "Response from bt_servant: Exodus 4:1-11:\n\nThen Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to my voice? For they may say, ‘The LORD has not appeared to you.’” And the LORD asked him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he replied. “Throw it on the ground,” said the LORD. So Moses threw it on the ground, and it became a snake, and he ran from it. “Stretch out your hand and grab it by the tail,” the LORD said to Moses, who reached out his hand and caught the snake, and it turned back into a staff in his hand. “This is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.” Furthermore, the LORD said to Moses, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, white as snow. “Put your hand back inside your cloak,” said the LORD. So Moses put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his skin. And the LORD said, “If they refuse to believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe that of the second. But if they do not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. Then the water you take from the Nile will become blood on the ground.” “Please, Lord,” Moses replied, “I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since You have spoken to Your servant, for I am slow of speech and tongue.” And the LORD said to him, “Who gave man his mouth? Or who makes the mute or the deaf, the sighted or the blind? Is it not I, the LORD?\n\nWould you like me to retrieve Exodus 4:12-16?", "client_ip": "2a03:2880:10ff:3::", "taskName": "Task-160", "timestamp": "2025-10-18 23:16:32", "level": "INFO", "logger": "bt_servant_engine.apps.api.routes.webhooks", "cid": "a4abe89ce25647b79c1a629b4137da46", "user": "kwlv1sXnUvYT9dnn"}
